- fill in license information
- fix / update all the cmds help text etc
- exponential retry for getting the cast application if it fails
- Maybe add config in home directory to enable user to set cast device etc, and store persistent data in there, eg: what has been played and when
- remaining commands:
    - list available casts
    - current status of chromecast
    - restart from beginning
    - seek delta seconds
    - go to end of playing media
    - playlist
        - this should try and sort based on numbers, then words?
        - some way for user to change the playlist order?
    - stop the cast from casting?
    - gui?
- remember what episodes have been played with timestamp
    - can we see how far they watched as well?
- debug should turn off logging, ie: log.SetOutput(ioutil.Discard)
- different logging levels, one really verbose for everything, one less verbose for everything minus the requests / responses
- regex device name match?
