- different logging levels, one really verbose for everything, one less verbose for everything minus the requests / responses
- exponential retry for getting the cast application if it fails
- playlist waits forever, need to see if there is someway make it wait until the playlist has finished?
    - Not sure what is possible here
- rename "seek" to "fastforward"?
- "application.LoadQueue" only validates the first file, needs to do the rest
- clean up code
+ move cache out of "application", the "cmd" should use it to
    + cache the device(-name) and ip address
    + get the played media list (currently in "application" but should be moved)
+ debug should turn off logging, ie: log.SetOutput(ioutil.Discard)
+ use logrus for better logging?
